# 📊 PEPS Ticket Into Insight Project 📊

Turning raw event ticket data into actionable insights for smarter resource planning at Carleton College’s PEPS department.

## 🔍 Overview

This project analyzes event ticket data from TeamDynamix (TDX) used by PEPS (Presentation, Events, and Production Support) to uncover patterns in event scheduling, workload distribution, and resource demand. Our goal is to provide clear, visual tools to help the department better anticipate and manage logistical needs.
